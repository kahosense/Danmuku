# Coach Persona – Feature Dossier

This folder captures the working documents for the English learning "Coach" persona. Use it as the single reference point for objectives, design, implementation sequencing, and validation criteria while the feature remains in development / experimental rollout.

## Contents
- `product-brief.md` – problem statement, user goals, success metrics.
- `technical-plan.md` – system architecture, component ownership, data/control flows.
- `implementation-roadmap.md` – phased build plan with milestones and dependencies.
- `prompt-design.md` – LLM prompting strategy: evaluation pass + response generation.
- `testing-plan.md` – QA scope, acceptance criteria, monitoring expectations.
- `decision-log.md` – running log of material decisions and outstanding questions.

Update these documents as plans change. When the feature graduates from experiment status, the relevant artifacts can be moved into the permanent docs structure.
